# Build Task Explorer #
Have you ever wonder where that particular build task was used? This extension adds an additional tab in Build and Release hub that lets you:

- See installed tasks
- Search for a specific task
- View details of a selected task:
    - Installed versions
    - Build definitions that use it
    - Status of the latest builds that use it

Since a task can be used in any team project an option is available on the details page to show which definitions the selected task is used regardless of project.

The extension is built and deployed to the VSTS Marketpace using VSTS, if you want to contibute to the public extension see [Contributions are welcome](#contributions-are-welcome).

## Building the extension ##

After cloning the repo change publisher and package settings in manifests/base.json. 

Dev workflow:
1. install tfx-cli globally: ```npm install -g tfx-cli```
1. run from root: ```tfx extension create --root ./ --output-path ./publish/ --manifests ./manifests/base.json --overrides-file manifests/dev.json --rev-version```
1. deploy the vsix file from publish/ folder to marketplace manually and share it with VSTS account where you want to test
1. install extension in account
1. run ```npm start``` from root of the project. This will start webpack-dev-server and serve your application to https://localhost:8080 where VSTS will pick it up. It might be necessary to visit the location directly first to persuade Chrome to ignore untrusted certificate.
